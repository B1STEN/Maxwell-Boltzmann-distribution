The Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann distribution is a probability distribution that describes the distribution of speeds (or velocities) of particles in a gas at thermal equilibrium
The distribution gives the **probability** that a particle will have a **certain speed** at a given **temperature**.

The program take 2 variables in input: _molar mass_ and _temperature of gas_ and outputs the distribution

p.s. it was my first attempt in programming for school project as a physics lover, so there are a lot of things need to be changed, but I don't want to. Just remain it unchanged in case I want to see how far (or not)I gone in my skills :D
